1. Description of the Problem:
Baby Seals is a local band that produces experimental, free jazz music. They perform in local cafes and such. However, Baby Seals lack any sort of digital representation to advertise themselves. Our goal is to create a platform that will resolve this issue and thus allow Baby Seals to better access and develop their fan base through digital means.

2. Basic approach of solution:
First, we will gather information and content about the band that can be displayed through the website. We shall provide easy access to all the bands info, such as tour dates, merch, about the band, and links to their music. This should potentially help increase the band’s popularity and fanbase, which is a solution to the problem.

3. Constraints (time, budget, etc.):
Time will of course be a constraint, considering the amount of work each of us has to burden from different classes. Budget doesn’t seem to be a concern at this point, as we already have the equipment needed to build a basic website. However, as some of our members have never created a website before, knowledge behind the technicalities can be considered a constraint. 

4. How success will be measured (how do we know we’re done?):
Success is met once we all jointly believe that we have fulfilled every single task. The website must be an accurate tool for to fully show who the band is and what they represent. The website will be successful as long as it is fully functional and aesthetically pleasing. In the end, once we are all happy with the final result, that would be the definition of success for our group
